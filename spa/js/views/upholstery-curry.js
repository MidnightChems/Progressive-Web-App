            <strong><u>Info:</u></strong>
            <p>Yellow Curry, most mustard and other pickled product will contain turmeric. Turmeric is an herbal plant in the ginger family grown in tropical South Asia. Once processed it has a deep orange yellow color that is used to color and flavor mustard and other food product. The color in this powder is strong enough to be used as a dye in fabrics. It is a potent disperse dye that will not always be removable from fiber while maintaining the original color of that fiber. If previous treatment and cleaning to the stain has occurred, it lessens the chance the stain can be removed.</p>
            <strong><u>Procedures:</u></strong>
            <ol class="procedures" type="1">

            <li>Wet affected area with Avenge Pro Spotter. Agitate into foam. Allow 2-3 minutes dwell time. Rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Repeat as long as staining material is being removed.</li>
            <li>Extract for maximum dryness.</li>

            <li>For synthetic fibers only: If color remains, dampen affected area with Stain Zone.</li>
