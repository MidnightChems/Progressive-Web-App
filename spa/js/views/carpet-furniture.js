            <strong><u>Info:</u></strong>
            <p>Note: The stain may be from metal touching damp carpet (rust - see rust procedure) or from furniture stain or natural colors as found in some red woods. If the stain is noticed during normal carpet cleaning while moving the furniture and was caused by moisture from the cleaning, quick action addressing the stain will usually result in success. Otherwise success on old stains may be spotty.</p>
            <strong><u>Procedures:</u></strong>
            <ol class="procedures" type="1">            
            <li>If fresh - apply Avenge Pro, agitate and extract.</li>
            <li>If no stain remains, mist with Spot Stop, and work in with a brush.</li>
            <p>If the stain remains or is older than a few minutes:</p>
            <li>Apply All Solv Xtreme to a clean white absorbent towel. Slowly wipe across the stained area from several directions. Continue if any staining material is being removed. Rinse out before next step.</li>
            <li>Apply Stain Zone to the stained fibers</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic to allow longer dwell time - up to 16 hours</li>
            <li>If stain remains - repeat. If the stain doesn't respond you may try Stain Zone with a heat treatment, but loss of carpet color is a potential issue.</li>
