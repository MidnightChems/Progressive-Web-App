            <strong><u>Info:</u></strong>
            <p>Yellowing may result from several factors or a combination of factors. Safer and simpler solutions are listed first. Test to see what process is safe and effective for each situation. Yellowing from age and/or exposure to sunlight will have weakened fabric. Proceed with caution.</p>
            <strong><u>Procedures:</u></strong>
            <ol class="procedures" type="1">            
            <li>Mix Fab-Set with warm water at 1:20. Spray a heavy mist onto the fabric. Work in with horse hair brush. Allow up to 10 minutes to determine if this corrects the yellowing.</li>
            <li>If yellowing remains, mix 4 oz. Oxybuff Cotton Shampoo with 1 gallon hot water. Whip into foam. Apply using horse hair brush. Allow up to 20 minutes dwell time. For white or near-white fabrics, cleaning in direct sunlight will increase the effectiveness of this treatment.</li>
            <li>Rinse. Make additional dry passes.</li>
            <li>Apply heavy mist of Spot Stop. Work in with fabric brush.</li>
            <li>If yellowing remains, create your own Haitian Cotton Shampoo by mixing Fabric Shampoo 1:16 with warm water. Add 1 oz. Coffee Stain Remover per gallon of ready-to-use solution. Whip into foam. Use horsehair brush to apply the foam and work it into the fabric. Allow 5 minutes to 20 minutes dwell time. For white or near-white fabrics, cleaning in direct sunlight will increase the effectiveness of this treatment.</li>
            <li>Rinse. Make additional dry passes.</li>          
            <li>Apply heavy mist of Spot Stop. Work in with fabric brush.</li>
